## ❓ The Game Works Without Resources!

**Don't have sounds/images yet?**  
No problem! The game will:
- Show the default golden bird (no avatar)
- Run silently (no sounds)
- Display helpful messages in console

You can add the resources later and restart the game!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Shorter meme sounds** (1-3 seconds) work better
2. **Square face images** look more realistic
3. **Crop your photos** close to just the face
4. **Mix serious and funny** faces for variety
5. **Background music** should be calm/low-energy so it doesn't distract

---

## 🎯 Where to Get Resources

### Sounds
- **YouTube to MP3**: Download meme sounds from YouTube
- **Freesound.org**: Free sound effects
- **Your Voice**: Record yourself saying something funny
- **Gaming Sites**: Royalty-free game music

### Images
- **Selfies**: Take a photo with your phone
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Use profile pictures
- **Photo Editor**: Crop and resize to square
- **Funny Edits**: Use apps to add filters or effects

## 📝 File Naming

### Sounds (Must be exact!)

meme2.mp3
meme3.mp3
```

### Avatars (Any name works!)
```
