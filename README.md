# Flappy Bird (JavaFX Edition) 🐦

Welcome to my take on the classic Flappy Bird game! I built this using JavaFX because I wanted to create something smooth, responsive, and a bit more feature-rich than the usual clones out there.

## What's Cool About This Version? ✨

It's not just a basic copy-paste. I added some fun stuff:

-   **Particle Effects**: When you jump or crash, there are cool little particle explosions. It just feels satisfying.
-   **Sound System**: I added background music and some funny meme sounds that play when you're in danger or crash.
-   **Custom Avatars**: You can actually put your own face (or your friends') on the bird! Just drop an image in the folder and you're good to go.
-   **Settings Menu**: Press 'S' in-game to tweak things without restarting.
-   **Smooth Gameplay**: It runs at a solid 60 FPS, so if you die, it's definitely your fault (sorry!).

## Getting Started 🚀

I made a script to handle the boring setup stuff.

### The Quick Way (Windows)
Just run the `setup-and-run.ps1` script. It'll download the JavaFX libraries you need and launch the game. Easy peasy.

### The Manual Way
If you prefer doing it yourself, check out `HOW_TO_RUN.md` for the step-by-step instructions.

## Controls 🎮

-   **Space / Click**: Flap your wings!
-   **S**: Open the Settings menu
-   **A**: Cycle through different avatars
-   **1, 2, 3**: Switch up the sound effects
-   **R**: Restart instantly after you crash
-   **Esc**: Rage quit (I mean, exit the game)

## Customizing It 🎨

Want to add your own sounds or faces?
Check out `RESOURCES_GUIDE.md`. I wrote a quick guide on how to drop your own files in so they show up in the game.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

-   **Java 22**: The core language.
-   **JavaFX 23**: For all the graphics and UI.
-   **JavaFX Media**: For the audio engine.

## License 📄

Feel free to use this code for whatever! Learning, modifying, or just messing around. It's open source.
