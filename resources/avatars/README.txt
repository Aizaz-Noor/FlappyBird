📁 AVATAR IMAGES FOLDER
========================

Add your face images here!

Recommended Format:
------------------
- PNG, JPG, or JPEG format
- Square images (1:1 ratio) work best
- Close-up face photos with face centered
- Resolution: 200x200 or higher

Example Files:
-------------
avatar1.png - Your face
avatar2.png - Friend #1 face  
avatar3.png - Friend #2 face
... add as many as you want!

Naming:
-------
You can name files anything you want! Examples:
- john.png
- sarah.jpg
- myself.png
- funny_face.jpeg

The game will automatically load all PNG, JPG, and JPEG files from this folder.

Tips for Best Results:
---------------------
1. Crop the image to show just the face (no full body)
2. Use square images (same width and height)
3. Center the face in the image
4. Use clear, well-lit photos
5. Transparent background (PNG) is optional but looks cool!

How to Get Good Face Images:
---------------------------
1. Take a selfie with your phone
2. Use a photo editor to crop to just the face
3. Resize to square (e.g., 300x300 pixels)
4. Save as PNG or JPG
5. Copy to this folder!

Fun Ideas:
----------
- Use serious photos for a funny contrast
- Edit faces with funny expressions
- Use celebrity faces
- Mix real photos with cartoon characters
- Create themed avatars (superheroes, animals, etc.)

Once you add your images, DELETE this README.txt file.
